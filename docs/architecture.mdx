# <span class="actual-font">OptimAI Network</span> Architecture

:::tip[Overview]
The OptimAI Network is an innovative **L2 DePIN Reinforcement Data Network for Agentic AI**, designed to empower users to **mine data, fuel AI, and earn rewards**. By transforming user-contributed data into the foundation for tomorrow’s AI agents, OptimAI creates a decentralized, scalable, and incentivized ecosystem. Its architecture revolves around four key pillars: the OptimAI DePIN Network, OptimAI Integrated Browser Nodes, OptimAI Reinforcement Data Layer, and OptimAI OP-Stack Layer 2 Blockchain.

OptimAI redefines AI development by placing users at the center. Through intuitive tools, anyone can **mine data** and contribute to AI innovation, earning OPI tokens as rewards. This participatory model turns everyday data into powerful AI agents, driving a future where AI is collaborative, accessible, and community-powered.
