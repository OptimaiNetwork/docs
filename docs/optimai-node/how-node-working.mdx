## Mining Data
### How It Works:
- The integrated browser node collects data as you navigate the web.
- It captures valuable insights, including:
  - Content from public and authenticated websites.
  - User interaction data (clicks, scrolls, navigation paths).
  - Sequential actions for advanced AI training.
### Your Role:
- Simply use your device as you normally would.
- Optionally participate in specific data collection tasks or missions.
- Ensure your node remains active to maximize contributions.

### Earning Rewards (OPI Points)
- Earning Mechanism:
  - Rewards are based on the volume and quality of data contributed.
  - Completing tasks and missions can grant you bonus OPI points.
- Tracking Earnings:
  - Use your dashboard to monitor accumulated OPI rewards.
  - View detailed reports on your contributions and rewards.
