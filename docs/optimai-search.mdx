OptimAI Search is a decentralized search experience powered by the OptimAI Network. When you search, our distributed nodes gather information from across the Internet, and our AI agent analyzes those submissions to produce a clear, useful answer. You also get supporting images for better visual context.

## Tips for better results
- Ask specific questions (include time range, location, or domain if relevant).
- Use natural language (e.g., “Compare X vs Y” or “Summarize the latest on Z”).
- For deeper results, run a follow-up query to narrow the scope.

## Example searches
- “What is OptimAI Network?”
  - You will see: a concise summary, key sources, and related images.
- “Best practices for securing smart contracts in DeFi”
  - You will see: a synthesized checklist with citations.
- “Compare carbon capture methods: direct air capture vs point-source”
  - You will see: a side-by-side overview with sources.
- “How do decentralized identity wallets work?”

- “What are common failure modes in large language models?”
  - You will see: an analysis with cited sources and visuals.

## Troubleshooting
- **I do not see images**: Some topics do not have strong visual matches. Try a more specific query.
- **My search did not run**: Check your daily limit, then try again later or connect your wallet.
- **Results feel too broad**: Narrow the query by adding a timeframe, industry, or location.
