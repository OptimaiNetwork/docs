## Node Architecture Overview

At the heart of OptimAI’s ecosystem is the **OptimAI Node**—software that can run on different types of devices with varying capabilities. Each node type plays a distinct role, collectively forming a resilient, decentralized network.

### 1. Lite Nodes
Designed for simplicity and low resource usage, **Lite Nodes** are perfect for users who want to contribute to the network without dedicating powerful hardware or constant uptime.

- **Browser Extension**  
  - **Seamless Integration**: Runs as an extension in popular browsers.  
  - **Data Validation**: Allows users to earn rewards by labeling, tagging, or voting on small data snippets.  
  - **Passive Data Capture**: Collects public browsing insights (with user consent) and relays them to the network in anonymized form.

- **Telegram Mini-App**  
  - **Chat-Based Interaction**: Operates inside Telegram as a mini-app, making it easy to validate data or perform annotation tasks within a familiar interface.  
  - **Lightweight Contributions**: No advanced hardware needed—just occasional engagement to confirm data or provide feedback.

**Use Cases for Lite Nodes**  
- Individuals looking to earn tokens by casually validating AI training data.  
- Users wanting a simple entry point into a decentralized AI ecosystem.

### 2. Core Nodes
For those with more robust hardware or a desire to contribute substantial resources, **Core Nodes** offer advanced capabilities, including an **integrated (built-in) browser environment** for comprehensive data mining from both public and authenticated sites.

- **Built-In Browser**  
  - **Authenticated Crawling**: Securely fetch data from sites requiring login credentials, such as subscription-based platforms or specialized forums.  
  - **Configurable Scripts**: Automate data-collection rules—deciding which pages to visit, when to crawl, and how to parse data fields.  
  - **High-Volume Data Mining**: Ideal for large-scale or domain-specific campaigns requiring frequent, targeted scraping.

- **Resource Powerhouse**  
  - **Advanced Hardware**: Utilize CPUs, GPUs, or large storage volumes for tasks like distributed AI training, big data processing, or advanced indexing.  
  - **Bandwidth Sharing**: Relay large datasets within the network to balance loads and prevent bottlenecks.  
  - **Continuous Operation**: Often run 24/7, receiving elevated rewards commensurate with their higher contribution.

**Use Cases for Core Nodes**  
- AI developers or data analysts who require deeper data access and can commit their machine(s) to continuous network operations.  
- Organizations seeking large-scale data pipelines and robust compute for specialized AI research.

### 3. Edge Nodes
**Edge Nodes** extend the OptimAI Network into mobile devices and IoT hardware, also featuring an **embedded browser environment** for data gathering—especially useful in on-the-go scenarios or IoT-driven platforms.

- **Real-Time Data**  
  - **Sensor Streams**: Capture time-sensitive info like location, temperature, user interactions, or environment metrics directly on the device.  
  - **Local Inference**: Perform quick AI tasks (e.g., object detection in camera feeds) without relying on external servers.

- **Built-In Browser for Mobile**  
  - **Context-Aware**: Mobile browsing can yield region-specific or scenario-specific data often missed by conventional approaches.  
  - **Adaptive Usage**: Functions at variable connection speeds, caching data for sync when stable bandwidth is available.

- **Low Latency Processing**  
  - **On-Device AI**: Running certain inference tasks locally improves speed and privacy.  
  - **Partial Updates**: Periodically send aggregated data or model adjustments back to the network, contributing to global AI improvements.

**Use Cases for Edge Nodes**  
- IoT deployments requiring real-time analytics with minimal latency (smart cities, industrial IoT, etc.).  
- Mobile-first users who want to capture unique, location-based data streams.

## Reinforcement Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Core Nodes scrape large volumes of domain-specific or gated content.  
   - Lite and Edge Nodes contribute partial data streams (public browsing data, sensor metrics) and help annotate new data.

2. **Validation & Rewards**  
   - Multiple nodes cross-check each data piece. If consensus is reached, data is approved and integrated into the global dataset.  
   - **Reinforcement Learning** techniques fine-tune how data is accepted or rejected, continually raising quality standards.

3. **Reward Function**  
   - Each node earns OPI tokens based on factors like data contribution, validation consistency, and resource provision.  
   - For instance, if $ P_i $ denotes processing power, $ B_i $ the bandwidth contribution, and $ D_i $ the amount of validated data for node $ i $, one simplified reward model could be:

   $$
   R_i = \alpha \cdot \bigl(P_i + B_i + D_i\bigr)
   $$

   Where $ \alpha $ is a scaling parameter reflecting the overall network demand at a given time.

4. **Iterative Quality Gains**  
   - Feedback loops update data confidence scores and node reputations.  
   - Over time, the dataset evolves to retain only the most accurate, diverse, and context-rich entries.

## OPI Token: The Economic Driver

### Earning OPI
1. **Data Contributions**  
   - Scraping authenticated content (Core Node) or ambient data (Edge Node).  
   - Passive browser extension data mining (Lite Node).
2. **Validation & Annotation**  
   - Confirm or label data samples.  
   - Conduct specialized domain-specific tasks (image bounding boxes, text sentiment, etc.).
3. **Infrastructure Sharing**  
   - Provide CPU, GPU, or storage to assist others’ training, inference, or indexing tasks.  
   - Offer bandwidth for distributing large datasets.

### Spending OPI
1. **Marketplace Transactions**  
   - Purchase premium datasets.  
   - Acquire pre-trained AI models or advanced analytics modules.  
   - Commission specialized scrapers or data labelers.
2. **Rent Compute Power**  
   - Scale your AI projects by accessing high-throughput, GPU-equipped Core Nodes.  
   - Pay only for the resources you utilize—perfect for short-term model training spikes.
3. **Network Governance**  
   - Stake OPI to propose or vote on protocol changes, funding allocations, and new ecosystem initiatives.  
   - The staking rewards for participant $ i $ at time $ t $ might follow:

   $$
   R_i(t) \;=\; k \cdot \frac{\,S_i\,}{S_\text{total}} \,\cdot\, T(t)
   $$

   Where $ S_i $ is the tokens staked by participant $ i $, $ S_\text{total} $ the total staked by all participants, and $ T(t) $ the total reward pool allocated at time $ t $.

## Technical Highlights

1. **Layer-2 Blockchain**  
   - A high-throughput environment that minimizes transaction costs for data validations, token rewards, and governance actions.  
   - Achieves near-instant finality, crucial for micro-rewards and fast data lifecycles.

2. **DePIN Resource Allocation**  
   - Distributes tasks to nodes with optimal availability, guided by real-time metrics.  
   - Another possible formula for node task assignment is a weighted approach:

   $$
   \text{Minimize:} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \,\left(\frac{L_i}{C_i}\right)
   $$

   Where $ L_i $ is the current workload of node $ i $, $ C_i $ its capacity, and $ w_i $ a priority weight (e.g., reliability, uptime).

3. **Edge Computing**  
   - Streamlined inference and data pre-processing at the source, reducing latency.  
   - Periodic aggregation of local model updates improves the global AI model pool, fostering a continuous loop of distributed learning.
