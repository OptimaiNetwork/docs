# <span class="actual-font">OptimAI Network</span> Architecture
OptimAI is a decentralized ecosystem designed for efficient, secure, and scalable AI data collection and development. It integrates advanced technologies to address modern challenges while remaining adaptable for future advancements. Its architecture is built on four core pillars: OptimAI DePIN Network, OptimAI Browser Nodes, OptimAI Reinforcement Data Layer and OptimAI OP-Stack Layer 2 Blockchain.

OptimAI Network is designed to be a community-driven network. Users are not just participants but active contributors to the evolution of AI technology. Community members contribute data, validate information, and run nodes to help grow the network and improve AI models. By contributing to OptimAI, users help build a more intelligent and accessible AI ecosystem. The data and computing power provided by the community fuel the continuous learning and adaptation of AI agents.
